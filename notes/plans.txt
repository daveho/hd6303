Video output:

TMS9928 + VRAM (need to research VRAM options, maybe just use 62256 SRAM?)

  Document describing interfacing TMS9918 with static RAM:

    Suggests using a 32K cache RAM (62256 with 70ns access time)

Circuit for converting YPbPr to RGB:

The schematic indicates MC34182 op amps are used.  Ordered some
MC34184 which are equivalent quad (rather than dual) op amp ICs.

Generating composite video from RGB+sync, MC1377 (ordered 4):

Not sure what additional components the MC1377 needs, need to
research.  Goal is to output video signal that can be displayed
on a composite monitor or TV.



Audio output: use either AY-3-8913 (have 3 of these, but they're somewhat
expensive to source) or YM2149F (40 pin, would provide 2 I/O ports, and
they're fairly cheap and easy to obtain.)  They require a max 2 MHz clock.
The system clock (E) is 1.2288 MHz.  That would probably be the easiest
approach.  Could also use additional 4 MHz oscillator and divide it by 2.
Already have PLD (ay8913.pld) to generate appropriate bus signals and
also divide an external clock.
